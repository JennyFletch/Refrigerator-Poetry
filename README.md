# Refrigerator Poetry [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A prototype for a React app collaboration. Users can create poems and other silliness using a refrigerator magnet style interface, as well as comment on other users' submissions. Fun to play with even at this very basic level.
